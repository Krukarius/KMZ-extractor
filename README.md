# KMZ-extractor
The .kmz files extractor tool

How to do:

1. Place the Python file in the directory, which stores a multitute of .kmz files
2. Double-click on the file
3. Wait a fw seconds until completed

Instead of the zip-compressed .kml files you should have them in the folder from now. This smallish file extracts everything, which is inside the .kmz archive. It can be a nice alternative to 7Zip software. Have fun!
